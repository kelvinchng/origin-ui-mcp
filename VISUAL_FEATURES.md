# Visual Component Assessment Features

## 🎯 Problem Solved

Claude Code agents needed a way to see what OriginUI components actually look like to make better recommendations. Without visual information, they could only rely on names and descriptions, which doesn't help users choose components that match their design needs.

## ✨ Solution: Visual Assessment Tools

### 📸 New Tool: `get_component_screenshot`

**Purpose**: Help LLMs understand component appearance to make better recommendations

**Parameters**:
- `componentId`: The component to visualize
- `theme`: Theme preference ("light", "dark", "both")

**What it provides**:
- Visual descriptions of component appearance
- Links to live examples on OriginUI
- Theme-specific information
- Mobile responsiveness details
- Use case recommendations based on visual style

### 🔍 Enhanced Search Results

Search results now include:
- Visual hints for each component
- Prompt to use screenshot tool
- Styling information (dark mode, responsive, etc.)

## 📋 Example Usage

### For LLMs/Claude Code Agents:

```
User: "I need a payment component for my checkout page"

Claude: Let me search for payment components and show you what they look like.

[Uses search_components with query "payment"]
[Uses get_component_screenshot for relevant components]

"I found a Payment Method Selection component (comp-163). Here's what it looks like:

[Visual description and links to examples]

This component features:
- Clean card-based layout for payment options
- Radio button selection for Card, PayPal, Apple Pay
- Dark mode support
- Mobile-friendly responsive design
- Professional styling suitable for e-commerce

This would work well for checkout flows and payment forms. Would you like me to show you the installation command?"
```

### For Users:

```
"Show me what the button components look like"
"I want to see the visual style of navigation components"
"Get a screenshot of the payment component"
```
